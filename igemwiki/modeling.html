                        To simulate the efficacy of DREP-based Vaccine, we compared between plus-strand RNA molecules of
                        traditional DNA vaccine replication vs plus-strand RNA molecules of DREP-based Vaccine within
                        VMS. using populations of numbers (in the cytoplasm) of plus-strand viral RNA molecules (RPC),
                        translation complexes (TC), viral polyprotein molecules (P), the enzyme NS5B and associated
                        viral proteins needed for RNA synthesis (EC), the numbers of plus-strand RNA within the VMS (
                        after self-amplification) (RP), dsRNA within the VMS (RD), viral polymerase complexes within the
                        VMS (E), the numbers of plus-strand RNA and dsRNA replicative intermediate complexes ( RIP and
                        RID) respectively.

                    <p>Plus-strand RNA, RPC, interacts with host cell ribosomes, (Ribo=10), to form a translation
                        complex at an effective rate k1. RPC, by forming polysomes, disappears at rate k1 and reappears
                        at rate k2 when translation is complete. Nucleases at the rate of MPC can degrade free
                        plus-strand RNAs in the cytoplasm, lost from the cytoplasm by transport into VMS at the rate of
                        kPin, and acquired by transport out of VMS at the rate of kPout.

                        In VMS, de novo development of RIPand RID complexes occurs with the rate constants k3 and k5,
                        respectively, and degrades with the MP2 and MD2 rate constants. The nascent plus- and
                        minus-strand RNAs are synthesised with rate constants of k4p and k4m , respectively. In VMS (RP
                        and Rds), free plus-strand RNA and dsRNA degrade with MP and MD2 rate constants, respectively.
                        Furthermore, the polymerase complex degrades or loses activity within VMS with a constant ME
                        rate, which is probably lower than the MEC cytoplasmic degradation rate.

                        Although, we have shown that replicon-based delivery outperform the traditional delivery, AFCM
                        Egypt-2020 found that other factors could control replicon function such as SGPs. So, the team
                        started by optimizing sets of SGPs for both EEV and SFV alpha viruses correlating their
                        stability with experimentally reported expression efficacy. AFCM Egypt-2020 selected SGP30 and
                        SGP15 because they have the highest expression rates as shown in the plot below.

                        And as shown in these graphs below, the number of +ve strand RNA is doubled by using SGP15 in
                        comparison to SGP30. That’s why we chose it in the circuit.

                        We have already simulated immune response against the three versions of multi-epitope vaccine,
                        yet, we wanted to simulate variation in immune response against DREP based delivery vs
                        traditional DNA vaccine delivery via T helper and DCs response.
                        Vaccine cells (VC) are supposed to be recognized by Cytotoxic T cells (TC) and Antibodies (AB)
                        that kill them. Killed VC releases both Interleukin-12 (IL12) and Tumor associated antigens
                        (TAA). TAA are captured by antigen presenting cells (APC) and then presented to T helper cells
                        (TH). IL12 stimulates both TH and TC actions. TH releases interleukin-2 (IL2) which boosts TH,
                        TC, and B actions and stimulates B cells to differentiate into plasma B cells (B). B releases
                        AB, and both AB and stimulated TC kill cancer cells (CC), which further release TAA.

                        Vaccine cells (VC) with a predefined dose are inserted into the host. The vaccine cell
                        inoculation is modelled by a kin(t, q) feature that adds q vaccine cells to the host cells at
                        time t, if an injection was planned at that time. Since vaccine cells come from the outside,
                        this concept is the only source of the equation.Cytotoxic T cells that recognise vaccine cells
                        by their allogeneic MHC class II molecules (term -a19TCVC) or by particular antibodies that can
                        specifically destroy vaccine cells by a complementary mechanism (term -a17ABVC) are blocked by
                        vaccine cells that die from various causes, such as natural death (term -μ1VC).

                        The dead or killed vaccine or cancer cells may release tumor-associated antigens (TAA). The
                        number of released antigens is thought to be equal to both the number of vaccine cells and the
                        number of suppressed cancer cells (VC and TAA respectively) (g21(a19TC+ a17AB+μ1)VC and g28
                        (a88+a89TC)VC). The root elements of the equation are represented by these two terms.Antigens,
                        such as dendritic cells , macrophages and B cells, are exposed to normal degradation (term
                        μ2TAA) and phagocytosis by antigen presenting cells (-a20APCTAA). In addition, antibodies can
                        bind to free immune complexes producing antigens (term -a27ABTAA).

                        The percentage of T helper activated cells is determined from the number of cells presenting
                        antigen (APC) that occur in the system (g40APC term). Interleukins 12 and 2 (IL12 and IL2) tend
                        to promote the priming and duplication of T helper cells (terms alp46 (IL2 IL2+s1)TH and
                        alp45(IL12 IL12+s2)TH). It is worth noting that these cells are able to self-stimulate their
                        activities because interleukin 2 is produced by T helper cells. The death factor is modelled on
                        the word -μ4TH.

                        Interleukin 12 (IL12) is mainly introduced through vaccine administrations, so it depends on the
                        vaccine dosage. In previous in vivo experiments [24] interleukin 12 was introduced separately,
                        but after transduction of IL2 genes inside vaccine cells [4], it is released by killed vaccine
                        cells, so it is proportional to the number of killed vaccine cells (term g51(a19TC + a17AB +

                        The release of interleukin 2 is mainly by T helper cells (g64TH term). Interleukin 2 induces T
                        helper priming, as previously mentioned, and primed T helper cells release more interleukin 2.
                        It is prone to natural degradation (-μ6IL2) and is partly consumed by cytotoxic T cell priming
